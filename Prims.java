/*9.	Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given undirected graph using Primâ€™s Algorithm.
Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. 
This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, 
where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. 
The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, 
from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection 
from the tree to another vertex.*/
