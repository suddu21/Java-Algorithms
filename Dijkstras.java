/*Technique used: Greedy Method
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm:
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, 
which may represent, for example, road networks.
For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between 
that node and every other.*/
